  <p>Hello, my name is Joseph Swetnam.</p>
  <p>This is a very minimal "Hello World" HTML document.</p>
  <p>I created this HTML document for ITD 110 &mdash; Web Design.</p>

    My favorite thing that I did this summer was going to Ocean City with my family.
    The hotel had an atrium with an ice skating rink, and my son discovered he loves
    ice skating. I also ate meat for the first time in years and was glad to discover
    that I haven't been missing much.
