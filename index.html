  <h4>let-></h4>
  <p>
    While working with <a href="https://github.com/xeqi/kerodon">kerodon</a> recently, I came across a situation where, in the middle of a threading macro <span class="fn-name">-></span> body, I wanted to capture an intermediate value and perform several tests on it without threading the results of one test to the next.  What I wanted was to use <span class="fn-name">as-></span> to capture the return value of the last form, with a <span class="fn-name">let</span> inside to do several things to that value.  I wrote a <span class="fn-name">let-></span> macro to do both in one step:
  </p>
  <pre
>    (defmacro let->
      [start-val binding-sym & body]
      `(as-> ~start-val x# (let [~binding-sym x#] ~@body)))
    
    (-> 1
        (cons [2 3])
        (let-> $
          (prn $) ;;=> prints "[1 2 3]"
          (count $))) ;;=> returns 3</pre>
  <p>
    To me, this provides a great deal of flexibility within a threading macro chain while still being quite easy to read and comprehend.
  </p>
  <p>
    I looked at some of the libraries out there that provide additional threading macros, but none seem to provide quite this one.  <a href="http://palletops.com/thread-expr/autodoc/pallet.thread-expr-api.html#pallet.thread-expr/let->">pallet.thread-expr</a> actually has a macro called <span class="fn-name">let-></span>, but it creates binding for new values, while mine only handles the value returned by the last form in the chain.  My form is more useful for my purposes, and I think it's truer to the general usage of <span class="fn-name">-></span> and the others.
